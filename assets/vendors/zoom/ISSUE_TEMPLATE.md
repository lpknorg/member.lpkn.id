Found an Issue?

Thanks for reporting it! If this looks like a bug it would be super helpful if
you could create a sample on CodePen to help me reproduce it.

Here is a template pen: https://codepen.io/spinningarrow/pen/WJprrg

It includes the necessary CSS and JS along with a sample image. Please fork it
in a way that demonstrates the issue, and paste the link in the issue
description.
